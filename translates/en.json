The evil sorceress Paris spreads only fear and chaos everywhere, people in distant regions of the continents survive with sheer willpower, struck by the curses and the poison of darkness. Each attempt to stop the dangerous sorceress resulted in diminishing population of humans and drakans. But you and your Brotherhood are here to turn the tide of this terrible war..",
